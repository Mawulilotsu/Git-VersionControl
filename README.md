## Overview
This repository serves as a **comprehensive guide to Git**, the most widely used **version control system** for tracking changes in software development. It covers essential Git concepts, workflows, and best practices for managing repositories efficiently.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- **Git Basics**: Repositories, commits, branches, and merges
- **Branching Strategies**: Feature branches, Git Flow, and trunk-based development
- **Remote Repositories**: GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
- **Collaboration & Code Review**: Pull Requests (PRs) and Merge Requests (MRs)
- **Rebasing vs Merging**: When and why to use each
- **Git Hooks**: Automating tasks with pre-commit and post-commit hooks
- **Advanced Git Commands**: Cherry-picking, reflog, interactive rebase

## 🚀 Projects & Use Cases
### 1️⃣ **Git Workflow Automation**
- Bash scripts for **automating Git commands**
- Predefined Git aliases for efficiency
- **Git hooks** for pre-commit validation

### 2️⃣ **Branching Strategy Implementation**
- Implementing **Git Flow** for structured development
- **Feature branching** best practices
- Resolving **merge conflicts efficiently**

### 3️⃣ **Git & CI/CD Integration**
- Automating deployments with **GitHub Actions**
- **Triggering Jenkins builds** based on Git events
- Managing releases with **semantic versioning**

## 🛠 Useful Git Commands
```sh
# Clone a repository
git clone <repo-url>

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Push changes to remote
git push origin feature-branch

# Merge a branch into main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch

# Revert a commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## 🎯 Best Practices
✅ Use **meaningful commit messages** 📝  
✅ Follow a **structured branching model** 🌱  
✅ Keep commits **atomic & focused** 🔍  
✅ Regularly **sync with remote repositories** 🔄  
✅ Use **.gitignore** to prevent committing unnecessary files 🚫
